#
#   Read the code below.  Predict (in your head)
#   what will get printed (i.e., displayed) when the code runs.
#
#   Then run this module by right clicking anywhere in this window
#   and then selecting:
#        Run 'name of file'
#   (i.e.  Run 'm1e_comments_strings...')
#
#       Or, use the Windows keyboard shortcut:
#           Control + Shift + Function-F10
#       That is, hold the Control, Shift and Function keys down
#       and press the F10 key.
#
#       To run the SAME module again, you can press the "Play" button --
#       the green, rightward-pointing triangle on the toolbar
#       that is above and to the right.
#
#   Confirm that you see the output in the  "Run"  window that appears.
#
#       Note: We recommend that you click on the "Gear" symbol
#       at the top-right part of that window and select
#           Move to  ~  Right Top
#       to make the output easier to see.
#       Try that now if you have not already done so.
#
#   Confirm that the output is what you expected, asking questions as desired.
#
#   This module is just an example (m1e, note the   e   ).
#   After you have read and run the code,
#   feel free to play with it briefly, then move on to m2.
